# The Ultimate Microcontroller Tutorial

__The Ultimate Microcontroller Tutorial__ is a collection of tutorials for some widely-used microcontrollers.
Each tutorial is composed with 3 sections.
* hardware design
* prototyping
* firmware development

On every tutorial, a custom shematics and PCB is designed.
All the hardware design will be able to make by the JLCPCB SMT Assembly service.
This makes students and learners can experience real-world like processes of design, development, prototyping, and mass production.
Thanks to the JLCPCB's affordable pricing, all the designed boards can be made similar or less price than the common development boards of each MCU variant.

The contents of this tutorial, hardware designs, and software source codes are open-sourced and in public on GitHub.
